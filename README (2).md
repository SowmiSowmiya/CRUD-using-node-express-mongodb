# Node.js, mongodb & Express: Simple Add, Edit, Delete, View (CRUD)

 Express-mongoDB-CRUD

 In this repository, I created a list of tasks in which you can add tasks, mark them if you did them, delete them and modify if you have to change something in some task. I used technologies like Express-handlebars and Bootstrap for the interface, NodeJS and Express for the backend logic, and mongoDB for the database.
